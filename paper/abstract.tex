  % Status
  Automatic generation of random values described by algebraic data types (ADTs)
  is often a hard task.

  % Situation
  State-of-the-art random testing tools can automatically synthesize random data
  generators based on ADTs definitions.
  %
  % In that manner, generated values comply with the structure described by
  % ADTs---something that proves useful when testing software which expects
  % complex input like web pages, images, or even programs.

  In that manner, generated values comply with the structure described by ADTs,
  something that proves useful when testing software which expects complex
  inputs.
  %
  % Problem
  However, it sometimes becomes necessary to generate structural richer ADTs
  values in order to test deeper software layers.

  % Solution

  In this work we propose to leverage static information found in the codebase
  as a manner to improve the generation process.
  %
  Namely, our generators are capable to consider how programs branch on input
  data as well as how ADTs values are built via interfaces.
  %
  % Concretely, we propose to consider not only ADTs definitions, but also how
  % programs branch on input data as well as how ADTs values get manipulated via
  % interfaces.
  %
  We implement a tool, responsible to synthezise generators for ADTs values
  while providing compile-time guarantees about their distributions.
  %
  Using compile-time predictions, we provide an heuristic that tries to adjust
  the distribution of generators to what developers might want.
  % \todo[inline,author=Ale]{Case study}
  Preliminary experiments of our approach are very encouraging.
