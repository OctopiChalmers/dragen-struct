The literature on random generation of structured data is vast, both in
practical and in theoretical terms.

%
% Boltzmann models
%
Boltzmann models \tocite are a general approach to randomly generating
combinatorial structures such as trees and graphs, and recently, closed
simply-typed lambda terms \tocite.
%
A random generator built around such models uniformly generates values of a
target size with a certain size tolerance.
%
However, it has been argued that this approach has theoretical and practical
limitations in the context of software testing \tocite.

%
% GodelTest
%
From the practical point of view, Feldt and Poulding propose G\"odelTest
\tocite, a search-based framework for generating biased data.
%
G\"odelTest uses non-determinism to generate a wide range of data structures.
%
Similar to our approach, it works optimizing the parameters governing the
desired biases on the generated data.
%
However, the optimization mechanism uses metaheuristic search for the best
parameters at runtime.
%
\dragenp on the other hand implements a analytic and composable prediction
mechanism that is used only used at compile time to optimize the generation
parameters, thus avoiding to perform any kind of runtime reinforcement.
